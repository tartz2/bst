# Threaded Binary Search Tree
This is my own implementation of a threaded binary search tree. 

It has no memory leaks, and it runs at a max of O(n) for insertion/deletion/searching as this threaded binary search trees doesn't auto balance.

I also have an implementation of an AVL Tree on my github here: https://github.com/tartz2/avl
